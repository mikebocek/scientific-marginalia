### Welcome! 

Hello, and welcome! This blog is a place for me to write about scientific topics that I find interesting (and that I hope you'll find interesting too.) 

### Who is this blog for? 

Broadly speaking, anyone who is interested in learning some more about science! I'm aiming to write at a level that's understandable to high-school students, but that hopefully will provide some insight and understanding to people at any level. My goal here is to explore some nooks and crannies of these topics, and hopefully humanize them a little bit.

### About me 

I'm a bioinformatics scientist working in the biotech industry. I started life as a bench/wet-lab scientist (undergrad in biochemistry), but found that I loved programming and data analysis during my PhD (in cancer biology). I've always been fascinated by DNA and its role in biology as an information carrier, and I think broadly this interest has motivated me throughout my career. You can find my publications at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lCpTSrYAAAAJ&hl=en) if you are interested!
